# Loan-Calculator
A Loan Calculating Application 

A small project testing my progress working with the DOM using JavaScript so far, also contains a little bit of Bootstrap.
Its an Application that an Accountant could use to quickly show their client the following;
How long it will take to pay a loan back? 
How much interest it would be? and 
How much the total amount will be?
